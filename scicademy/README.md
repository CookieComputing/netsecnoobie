# Captcha Exploits

I was bored today and I wanted to do something interesting, so I decided to attack my friend's website (with his permission, of course).


It turns out that he forgot to add a captcha to his website, so as a practical joke, I decided to whip up something to tell him to work on that captcha ;)
